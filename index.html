Requirements

    Users will be able to list recent Gists from GitHub.
-->
    <form onsubmit="getGists(this); return false;">
      <!-- 
        Users will be able to pick between 1 and 5 pages of results to display (a page is 30 results by default). You should use an appropriate input to facilitate this.
              These need not be displayed as separate pages to the user, it only changes the number of total results
      -->

      <fieldset>
        <legend>
          Choose how many pages of results you would like displayed: 
        </legend>

        <label>
          <input type="radio" name="pagecount" value="1" checked="checked" /> 1
        </label>

        <label>
          <input type="radio" name="pagecount" value="2"/> 2
        </label>

        <label>
          <input type="radio" name="pagecount" value="3"/> 3
        </label>

        <label>
          <input type="radio" name="pagecount" value="4"/> 4
        </label>

        <label>
          <input type="radio" name="pagecount" value="5"/> 5
        </label>

      </fieldset>

      <!--
        Users will be able to select, via check boxes, the language of Gists they want to see. At a minimum this list will include Python, JSON, JavaScript and SQL
            Selecting languages should filter out results when the search button is clicked. That is to say if 30 results would have been returned, <= 30 results will be returned due to filtering. Presumably this will often be many less than 30.
            Selecting no languages should return all Gist results.

      <fieldset>
        <legend>
          Select the language of Gists you want to see:
        </legend>

        <label>
          <input type="checkbox" name="languages" value="Python" /> Python
        </label>

        <label>
          <input type="checkbox" name="languages" value="JSON" /> JSON
        </label>

        <label>
          <input type="checkbox" name="languages" value="JavaScript" /> JavaScript
        </label>

        There should be a search button. Clicking on this button should initiate the search. Results should be displayed without requiring a page reload.
        -->
        <br>

        <input type="submit" value="Search" />

    </form>

  <!--
        There should be a search button. Clicking on this button should initiate the search. Results should be displayed without requiring a page reload.
        After searching users will be able to see, at a minimum the Gist description which will double as a link to the html version of the gist.
            If you wish to optionally show additional data about the Gists you may do so but it is not required.
        Gists which have been added to favorites should not show up in the list of Gists returned by the search.
        Gists listed in the results should have a button to add them to the list of favorites.
            Clicking this button should visually change the location of the Gist so it shows up in a spatially different location from the list of search results.
            Clicking the button should save enough data to recreate the description and HTML link on subsequent visits to the page
        The favorites list should show up upon visiting the page and be marked by a heading. If it is empty the heading should still display.
            Optionally you can add text indicating that there are no currently saved favorites.
        Every entry in the favorites should include the description of the Gist and the HTML link to the Gist
        Every entry in the favorites should have a button to remove it from the list of favorites
            Clicking that button should make the item immediately disappear and it should not reappear in the favorites list on subsequent reloads.
